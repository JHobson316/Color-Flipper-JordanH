### Progress Report #1 (Technically 3) ###

- I don't think I've placed all of the html elements that I'm gonna need for the project, but definitely gonna need to look over changing css with the DOM a bit more. That seems to be my main problem at the moment, but I'm confident that it shouldn't be a problem for much longer.

### Progress Report #2 (Technically 4) ###

- Finished the background color changer, and added images in as a random choice button also!
